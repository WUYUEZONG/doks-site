> Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) is a compiler feature that provides automatic memory management of Objective-C objects. Rather than having to think about retain and release operations, ARC allows you to concentrate on the interesting code, the object graphs, and the relationships between objects in your application.Our company vision is to be the authoritative reference point for environmentally conscious buyers and to encourage more sustainable business practices through curating beautiful, practical, consciously-produced products.
